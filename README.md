# Rick_and_Morty_Game

This is the final version of my game. This is a goalie war game where the cartoon goailies (rick, peter) bounce the ball around and try to score on the others goals. The ball bounces off the walls goalies and goal sides and a goal is only scored when the ball hits the front of the goal. 
The score can be read from the bottom of the screen.
There is a celibration sound effect that sound when a goal is scored
